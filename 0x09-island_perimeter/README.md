The following codes are for ALX 0x09-island_perimeter project within the alx-interview curriculum, inside it contains the following code:
```
  Create a function def island_perimeter(grid): that returns the perimeter of the island described in grid:

        * grid is a list of list of integers:
               -> 0 represents water
               -> 1 represents land
               -> Each cell is square, with a side length of 1
               -> Cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
               -> grid is rectangular, with its width and height not exceeding 100
        * The grid is completely surrounded by water
        * There is only one island (or nothing).
        * The island doesn’t have “lakes” (water inside that isn’t connected to the water surrounding the island).
```
